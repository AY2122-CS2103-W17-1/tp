ContaX is a **desktop application for managing your Contacts and Schedule**. It is a powerful tool *optimized for use via a Command Line Interface* (CLI), while incorporating Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements to make it user-friendly. If you are able to type fast, ContaX is capable of helping you manage your contacts and schedule more efficiently than traditional GUI applications, allowing you to shift your focus to other things.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Upon click, the default OS file picker should show up, with filters for only .csv and .json files to be accepted. Accessing import via the top menu will allow users to import their task and appointments list as JSON/CSV files that were generated by another instance of ContacX.
