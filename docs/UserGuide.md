ContaX is a **desktop application for managing your Contacts and Schedule**. It is a powerful tool *optimized for use via a Command Line Interface* (CLI), while incorporating Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements to make it user-friendly. If you are able to type fast, ContaX is capable of helping you manage your contacts and schedule more efficiently than traditional GUI applications, allowing you to shift your focus to other things.

Broadly speaking, ContaX consists of an *Address Book* for managing Contacts, and a *Schedule* for managing Appointments.

   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Editing the data file

ContaX contacts and appointments data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes contact data in JSON format at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/schedule.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ContaX will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

### Importing data

In order to import data from external sources into ContaX, there are the following options:

* Replacing `addressbook.json` or `schedule.json` file with a valid ContaX formatted generated by another system with ContaX
* [Simple CSV import (GUI-based option)](#simple-csv-import)
* [Advanced CSV import (Command based)](#advanced-csv-import--importcsv)

### Importing CSV Files: `importcsv`

Format: `importcsv f/FILEPATH [n/COLUMNNUM] [p/COLUMN_PERSON] [e/COLUMN_EMAIL] [a/COLUMN_ADDRESS] [t/COLUMN_TAGS]`

  Name - Phone - Email - Address - Tagged
* This user guide will be updated later on with templates for importing for the following contact csv formats:
  * Google Contacts
  * Outlook Contacts

Examples:
* `importcsv f/file.csv n/2 p/3 e/5 a/6 t/4`
  * Reads from a CSV file treating the 2nd column as names, 3rd column as phone numbers, 5th column as email addresses, 4th column as tags.
* `importcsv f/file.csv n/2`
  * Reads from CSV treating the 2nd column as names, 3rd column as phone numbers, 4th column as email addresses, 5th column as tags.
