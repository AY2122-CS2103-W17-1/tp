### Project: ContaX

ContacX is for professionals who have many clients, current and prospective, who may possibly work with sensitive personal information and documents related to each of those clients. They have busy schedules with many appointments & meetings, and must be able to find available time slots in their schedules quickly.

ContacX will allow for efficient management of a large list of contacts, allowing the mental workload of remembering people and related scheduled tasks to be offloaded. It will also provide an efficient way of efficiently organizing resources, while having minimal downtime with seamless transition from existing solutions.
